🧠 Python Mini Projects Repository

Welcome to my Python Mini Projects collection!
This repository is a growing compilation of short, self-contained Python programs designed to improve my understanding of fundamental programming concepts, including logic, loops, conditionals, functions, and data handling.

Each subfolder contains an independent mini-project, complete with its own code files and documentation.

📂 Projects Included
1️⃣ Caesar Cipher Code

A simple encryption tool that demonstrates text manipulation and algorithmic logic using the classic Caesar Cipher technique.
The program allows users to:

Choose between encoding or decoding text.

Input a message and specify a shift value.

Instantly see the encrypted or decrypted output.

This project reinforces string handling, user input validation, and basic modular arithmetic in Python.

2️⃣ Other Folders (In Progress)

Life in weeks – Calculates how many weeks a person has left if they live to 90 years old.

Love calculator – Fun project that counts matching letters to produce a "love score."

Secret Auction – Simulates a silent bidding game using dictionaries and loops.

Each project is being refined and documented over time.

⚙️ Technologies Used

1. Python 3.x

2. VS Code (for coding and debugging)

3. Git + GitHub (for version control)

4. Command Line / Git Bash (for terminal operations)

📈 Purpose of the Repository

This repository documents my progress through Python practice projects, focusing on:

Building problem-solving skills.

Writing clean, readable, and reusable code.

Gradually advancing toward automation and real-world applications and possible AI and Machine Learning.
