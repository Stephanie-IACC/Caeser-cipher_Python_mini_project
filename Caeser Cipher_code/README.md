🧩 Caesar Cipher – Python Mini Project

This project implements the Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques in cryptography.
Developed as part of a Python mini-project, it demonstrates how messages can be encoded and decoded by shifting letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

The program allows users to:

Choose between encryption and decryption modes.

Enter a custom message and shift value.

View the resulting encrypted or decrypted text instantly.

This project was created to strengthen understanding of loops, string manipulation, and basic algorithmic thinking in Python.
It serves as a great introduction to how classical ciphers work and how modern encryption evolved from these early ideas.
